# The ResumeBook

ResumeBook lets users concisely present their skills, experience and past work on their profile. Portfolio content is assumed to be hosted elsewhere but represented on the site as a link and a thumbnail.

Other users or guests can leave comments on a userâ€™s skills and experience as well as each past project they post. Each comment will be run through a sentiment analysis API and only displayed by default if it is positive.
